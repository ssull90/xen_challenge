# Xen Challenge Backend Service

This service has a few endpoints you develop and test your coding challenge.

## Prerequisites
The API application runs in a docker container. Install docker before following any other steps:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

## Getting Started

1. First build the docker container by running:
    ```sh
    docker compose build
    ```
2. Next, start the container:
    ```sh
    docker compose up
    ```

The container will run on port 3000 of your machine by default.
If you'd like to change this, simply edit the `docker-compose.yml` to expose a different port.
E.g. to change the API webservice to port 5555 on your machine:

From:

    ...
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
        ports:
          - "3000:3000"
    ...

To:

    ...
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
        ports:
          - "3000:5555"
    ...

...then simply re-run step 2 above to start the service on the new port


## Usage
The container has several available endpoints for you to query related to invoices.
